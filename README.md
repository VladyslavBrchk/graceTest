# Grace Test Task

This is TypeScript Playwright automation tests created to test some functionality 
of the [Grace](https://dev-admin.grace-technology.io/) website.

These test are applied for the Sales Page of this Website

## Installing

These instructions will help you to download the project on your local machine.

1. First of all you need to install a Node.js from this [site](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using **Command prompt**:

```
git clone https://github.com/VladyslavBrchk/graceTest
```

3. Navigate to the project directory (manually or by using command below):

```
cd graceTest
```

4. Open this project using any code editing programe, for example [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


5. Open the terminal (for VSCode it is **Ctrl + Shift + `** hot keys or Terminal > New Terminal in the navigation menu). After that to install all the dependencies run:
```
npm install
npm init playwright@latest
```
## How to start your tests

These instructions will help you to run the tests.

There are some pre-defined scripts to run the tests:

* To run tests in the chromium browser in the headless mode use
    ```
    npm run test:chromium:headless
    ```
* To run tests in the chromium browser in the headed mode use
    ```
    npm run test:chromium:headed
    ```

## Answers to the Test Task questions

**Q:** What good automation QA is? </br>
**A:** The good QA automation has several crucial details. Automation tests should **cover critical functionalities** to ensure that the software meets its requirements and functions as expected. Automation tests should **be integrated into the development process as early as possible**. Automation frameworks should be **designed in a modular and scalable manner**, allowing for easy maintenance, extension, and reuse of test cases. Automation tests **should execute quickly** to provide timely feedback to developers. This requires efficient test scripts, parallel execution capabilities, and optimization of test environments. Automation tests should be seamlessly **integrated into the CI/CD pipeline** to ensure that builds are automatically tested and deployed.**Test results should be well-documented**, with detailed reports highlighting test coverage, pass/fail status, and any defects identified.

**Q:** What you love and donâ€™t love about automation QA? </br>
**A:** I like the process of writing code, solve the challenging tasks (for example, searching the hard locators), optimise the current projects. Overall, I am passionate about leveraging my skills and experience in QA Test Automation to contribute to the success of projects. But sometimes I had to automise the tests for sites with very raw design without any communication wih developers, so I tried to deal with it myself. So that is what I don't like about automation in all, the possibility of lack of communication. Hpwever, I am sure that such situations are rare.

**Q:** Why you think you are a great QA engineer? </br>
**A:** With a strong foundation in programming languages such as **JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, HTML/CSS markup** along with proficiency in **Windows platform**, I've got a diverse set of skills. I offer a range of services including **Automated Testing (Web, Mobile, API), Manual Testing, UI/UX Testing, and Writing Test Documentation**. In terms of frameworks and tools, I have practical experience with **Playwright, WebdriverIO, Cucumber, Cypress** allowing me to efficiently automate tests and ensure the reliability and stability of software products. In terms of API testing, I am proficient in using tools like **Postman, Axios, and Swagger** enabling efficient testing of web services and APIs. Additionally, my experience with Test Management and Issue-Tracking tools like **Atlassian Jira, TestRail and Mantis BT** ensures streamlined test planning and tracking processes. I also have hands-on experience with Continuous Integration and Version Control Systems, primarily **GIT**, which allows for seamless integration of automated tests into the development pipeline. In additiion, I am good team player, attentive to details and problem-solving. Overall, I like to study something new and can quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies in the field.
